This repository uses seq2seq LSTM based models for the following data sets:

**1. SQuAD2.0**

For This dataset I have included three varients of seq2seq models, one is with out attention and other two are two varients of double encoder attention.
The details of the model varient are specified in the notebooks, text cells.

**2. Cornell dialogue dataset.**

**3.**

Each dataset is run on two versions of seq2seq models. 1. with out attention. 2. With attention.
